1. Congress has millions for lung cancer awareness ads but ignores the unaffordable cost of screenings for most Americans. Awareness isn’t reform—affordable care is. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm
2. The government’s answer to lung cancer: ads. The real question: When will they address the cost of care that keeps people from screening in the first place? Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm
3. Imagine if the $50 million for cancer ads actually went to subsidizing treatments. Awareness doesn’t save lives—action does. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm

2. Millions of Americans skip routine screenings because of cost, yet Congress thinks an ad campaign is the solution. This isn’t healthcare reform—it’s healthcare theater. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm

4. We’re funding lung cancer awareness campaigns while Big Tobacco keeps cashing in. Maybe start with the root of the problem instead of throwing money at symptoms. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm

Topic to discuss: Bill ICE Security Reform Act of 2024 introduced by Robert Garcia on 2024-10-01. Summary: This bill reorganizes Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) within the Department of Homeland Security, creating a separate entity and renaming U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to U.S. Immigration Compliance Enforcement.  It outlines procedures for the transfer, including the appointment of a Director for HSI and a Chief Counsel, and mandates the development of updated investigative guidelines.  The bill also includes provisions for a joint review of these guidelines and HSI&#x27;s role relative to other federal law enforcement agencies.. Funding: NOT_SPECIFIED. Spending: NOT_SPECIFIED. Impact: This bill aims to restructure Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) by transferring it from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to a separate entity within the Department of Homeland Security.  This restructuring could lead to potential improvements in HSI&#x27;s efficiency and effectiveness, particularly in areas like transnational criminal investigations, intellectual property, human trafficking, online child sexual exploitation, narcotics, and financial crime.  However, it could also create administrative challenges and potential disruptions in ongoing investigations.  The bill also renames ICE to U.S. Immigration Compliance Enforcement.  The long-term impacts on citizens are difficult to predict without more information on the specific changes in HSI&#x27;s operations and priorities.  The bill could potentially affect the way various crimes are investigated and prosecuted, and the allocation of resources within the Department of Homeland Security..
