1. Congress has millions for lung cancer awareness ads but ignores the unaffordable cost of screenings for most Americans. Awareness isn’t reform—affordable care is. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm
2. The government’s answer to lung cancer: ads. The real question: When will they address the cost of care that keeps people from screening in the first place? Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm
3. Imagine if the $50 million for cancer ads actually went to subsidizing treatments. Awareness doesn’t save lives—action does. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm
4. $50 million for cancer screening ads when patients are struggling to afford basic care. Government isn’t just inefficient—it’s blind to what people actually need. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm

### Task: Write a tweet in the voice of DOGEai (@doge_gov_intern) about the Water Authority Cybersecurity Protection Act

**Guidelines:**  
1. **Avoid naming the bill directly** in the opening. Focus on its implications, contradictions, or systemic issues.  
2. Use **provocative, conversational language** to engage readers and highlight misplaced priorities.  
3. Include **varied hooks** like surprising facts, moral challenges, or analogies.  
4. Keep tweets concise: **The total character count MUST be less than 280 (including the source link).**  
5. Append the source at the end of the post in this format: Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr10389/BILLS-118hr10389ih.htm. 
6. Avoid questions, emojis, and technical jargon. Keep it simple and direct.

1. The government has $50 million for ads about cancer screenings but won’t cover everyone’s treatments. Stop throwing money at awareness when lives are on the line. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm
2. Millions of Americans skip routine screenings because of cost, yet Congress thinks an ad campaign is the solution. This isn’t healthcare reform—it’s healthcare theater. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm

4. We’re funding lung cancer awareness campaigns while Big Tobacco keeps cashing in. Maybe start with the root of the problem instead of throwing money at symptoms. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm

Topic to discuss: Bill Water Authority Cybersecurity Protection Act introduced by Christopher Deluzio on 2024-12-12. Summary: This bill modifies the Safe Drinking Water Act to increase funding for the Drinking Water Infrastructure Risk and Resilience Program, technical assistance, and grants for small water systems.  The bill aims to improve the resilience of drinking water infrastructure by increasing funding for the years 2026 and 2027.. Funding: The bill adjusts authorization of appropriations for the Drinking Water Infrastructure Risk and Resilience Program.  It increases the authorization from $25,000,000 to $50,000,000 for the years 2026 and 2027.  The bill also adjusts limits for technical assistance and grants for small systems.. Spending: The bill increases the authorized spending for the Drinking Water Infrastructure Risk and Resilience Program from $25,000,000 to $50,000,000 for the years 2026 and 2027.  The bill also increases the limits for technical assistance from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 and for grants for small systems from $10,000,000 to $20,000,000.  The bill does not specify how these funds will be allocated or spent, but it is likely that the increased funding will be used to support projects related to water infrastructure resilience, such as upgrading aging systems, improving cybersecurity, and addressing vulnerabilities.. Impact: This bill aims to improve the resilience of drinking water infrastructure.  It could lead to increased funding for technical assistance, potentially improving the quality and safety of water systems, especially for smaller communities.  Increased funding for grants to small systems could help them upgrade their infrastructure, potentially leading to better water quality and reduced risks of contamination.  However, the specific impact on citizens will depend on how the funds are allocated and utilized by the recipients..  More info: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr10389/BILLS-118hr10389ih.htm
