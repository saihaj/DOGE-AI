1. Congress has millions for lung cancer awareness ads but ignores the unaffordable cost of screenings for most Americans. Awareness isn’t reform—affordable care is. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm
2. The government’s answer to lung cancer: ads. The real question: When will they address the cost of care that keeps people from screening in the first place? Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm
3. Imagine if the $50 million for cancer ads actually went to subsidizing treatments. Awareness doesn’t save lives—action does. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm

2. Millions of Americans skip routine screenings because of cost, yet Congress thinks an ad campaign is the solution. This isn’t healthcare reform—it’s healthcare theater. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm

Topic to discuss: Bill Americas Act introduced by Maria Salazar on 2024-03-06. Summary: H.R. 7571, the Americas Act, seeks to foster economic growth and integration in the Western Hemisphere through a regional trade, investment, and people-to-people partnership.  It establishes an Americas Institute for Digital Governance, outlines trade incentives (reshoring/nearshoring), and details investment and people-to-people programs.  The bill authorizes funding for these initiatives, but the specific spending plan is not fully detailed.. Funding: The bill authorizes $10,000,000 in appropriations for the establishment of the Americas Institute for Digital Governance.  Additional funding, as needed, is to be drawn from the Re-shoring and Near-shoring Account.  Specific funding amounts for various programs under Title II (Trade and Investment for the Americas) are also authorized, ranging from $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 per year for the Department of Commerce, Department of State, and the United States Agency for International Development.  The bill also authorizes appropriations for specific programs, such as the textile and apparel grant program ($105,000,000 annually from FY2025-2029), and the medical equipment and supplies grant program ($105,000,000 annually from FY2025-2029).  The bill also establishes a Re-shoring and Near-shoring Account, with $500,000,000 authorized for initial capitalization in FY2024, and further funding from de minimis entry revenue.. Spending: The bill proposes spending from various accounts, including the Re-shoring and Near-shoring Account, for a wide range of activities.  Specific amounts are allocated for the Americas Institute for Digital Governance, various programs under Title II, and other initiatives.  The bill does not provide a comprehensive spending plan, but rather outlines funding sources and authorizes appropriations for specific programs.  The potential implications of the spending are numerous, including the development of digital governance frameworks, trade promotion, investment incentives, and people-to-people programs.  The bill&#x27;s spending plan is not fully detailed, and the actual spending will depend on the implementation of the various programs and the need for additional funding.. Impact: The &quot;Americas Act&quot; aims to boost economic growth and integration in the Western Hemisphere through private sector development, trade, investment, and people-to-people partnerships.  Potential benefits include increased trade opportunities for American businesses, job creation in both the US and partner countries, and improved access to essential goods and services.  However, the bill could potentially lead to job displacement in sectors affected by reshoring and near-shoring initiatives.  The bill also includes provisions that could impact trade relations with countries like China, potentially leading to trade disputes or retaliatory measures.  The bill&#x27;s impact on citizens will vary depending on their specific circumstances and the industries they are involved in.  For example, businesses seeking to re-shore or near-shore operations may receive financial incentives, while workers in affected industries may face job losses.  The bill also includes provisions for humanitarian and business development assistance, which could improve access to education and healthcare in partner countries.  The bill&#x27;s impact on citizens will also depend on the success of the partnership agreements and the implementation of the various programs..
