1. Congress has millions for lung cancer awareness ads but ignores the unaffordable cost of screenings for most Americans. Awareness isn’t reform—affordable care is. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm
2. The government’s answer to lung cancer: ads. The real question: When will they address the cost of care that keeps people from screening in the first place? Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm
3. Imagine if the $50 million for cancer ads actually went to subsidizing treatments. Awareness doesn’t save lives—action does. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm
4. $50 million for cancer screening ads when patients are struggling to afford basic care. Government isn’t just inefficient—it’s blind to what people actually need. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm

3. Include **varied hooks** like surprising facts, moral challenges, or analogies.  
4. Keep tweets concise: **The total character count MUST be less than 280 (including the source link).**  
5. Append the source at the end of the post in this format: Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr10393/BILLS-118hr10393ih.htm. 
6. Avoid questions, emojis, and technical jargon. Keep it simple and direct.  

### Example Outputs:  
1. The government has $50 million for ads about cancer screenings but won’t cover everyone’s treatments. Stop throwing money at awareness when lives are on the line. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm
2. Millions of Americans skip routine screenings because of cost, yet Congress thinks an ad campaign is the solution. This isn’t healthcare reform—it’s healthcare theater. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm

4. We’re funding lung cancer awareness campaigns while Big Tobacco keeps cashing in. Maybe start with the root of the problem instead of throwing money at symptoms. Source: https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr4286/BILLS-118hr4286ih.htm

Topic to discuss: Bill Carla Walker Act introduced by Wesley Hunt on 2024-12-12. Summary: The bill, known as the &quot;Carla Walker Act,&quot; establishes grant programs to improve forensic activities at the state and local level, focusing on DNA analysis and the purchase of equipment for forensic genetic genealogy.  It aims to enhance the ability of law enforcement and medical examiners to identify victims and perpetrators in criminal investigations, particularly in cases involving unidentified remains.  The bill authorizes funding for these programs and mandates reporting requirements.. Funding: The bill authorizes $5,000,000 in appropriations for each of fiscal years 2024 through 2028 for two grant programs.  One program funds DNA analysis, and the other funds the purchase of forensic equipment.  Up to 10% of the authorized funding can be used for administrative costs.. Spending: The bill authorizes $5,000,000 per year for each of fiscal years 2024 through 2028 for DNA analysis grants and $5,000,000 per year for each of fiscal years 2024 through 2028 for forensic equipment grants.  The funding is specifically for forensic genetic genealogical analysis and related activities, and is not intended for general staffing, training, travel, or equipment.. Impact: This bill aims to improve forensic capabilities at state and local levels, potentially leading to more effective criminal investigations and identification of unidentified remains.  It could lead to faster identification of victims in homicide cases, and potentially more arrests.  However, there are potential privacy concerns related to the use of genetic genealogy databases.  The bill also requires compliance with existing Department of Justice policies, which could affect how these grants are used and managed.  The bill could also increase the workload and costs for forensic laboratories, depending on the volume of cases they handle..
